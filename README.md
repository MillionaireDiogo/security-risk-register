# Security Risk Register for Startups

This repository serves as a **portfolio reference** for a comprehensive Security Risk Register I have developed and maintain in Notion.

## Whatâ€™s Here

This repo does **not** contain the full register to avoid duplication and version conflicts.

## Live Risk Register

The detailed and dynamic Risk Register is hosted on **Notion**, where I manage:

- Real-time updates
- Task assignments and ownership
- Compliance mapping (NDPR, GDPR, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Risk scoring and mitigation tracking
